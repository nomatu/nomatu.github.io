#For Homework 1, I created two algorithms to the greyscale image and blurred image. For the greyscale image, I  calculated the sum of the product of 3D matrix of image values and the 3D matrix containing[0.07, 0.72, 0.21]. 
#Then, the output matrix is converted to absolute values of the elements.
#For the blurred image, I ran the image though a box filter, with the box kernel being set to a 19 x 19 array with 1/19 value.
